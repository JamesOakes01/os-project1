# os-project1
I followed the tutorial at https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/
as directed in the assignment instructions. Because of how step-by-step it was, the project basically became me just copy/pasting into my VM from the instructions.
After the fourth chapter (over half way through) it didn't really feel like I was getting very much from this assignment. I was basically just following an instruction guide on how to write the existing source code.
So I decided that the original source code would probably be a better guide. I have directly used the original source code I found at https://github.com/antirez/kilo
I am currently writing this README file with the kilo editor!

How to use:
When you clone the git repo, you can run the kilo file with ./kilo
Alternatively it can be recompiled from the kilo.c file with the "make" command. I had some trouble with this after switching to using the original source code but I think I got it worked out. The original source code does also have a Makefile included that would work.
The project requires no other dependencies other than the ability to compile C code.

Syntax for kilo: ./kilo [filename]
