# os-project1
I followed the tutorial at https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/
as directed in the assignment instructions. Because of how step-by-step it was, the project basically became me just copy/pasting into my VM from the instructions.
After the fourth chapter (over half way through) it didn't really feel like I was getting very much from this assignment. I was basically just following an instruction guide on how to write the existing source code.
So I decided that the original source code would probably be a better guide. I have directly used the original source code I found at https://github.com/antirez/kilo
I am currently writing this README file with the kilo editor!
